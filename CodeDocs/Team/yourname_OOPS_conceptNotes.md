1. What's Encapsulation:

2. Below code is fine?
    Clas A{
      PRivate password;
   }

   class MainRun{

    A a = new A();
   print(a.password);
   }

3. Polymorphism:
Types:
Overriding uses inheritance?
Overloading uses inheritance?


4. Interface:
   Supports Polymorphism?

5. Arrang the order of classes:
   Base class2, base class 1, Interface, MainClass
   Base class2, base class 1, Abstract class, MainClass
    PErson, Student, InternStudent 

6. Dynamic binding:
    In hierarchical inheritance of Student class, extended by Interstudent and extended by RegularStudent.
   Create objects and Show.
   
      Explicit casting
     Implicit casting
   
7. Include  a student if 1. intern 2. yearofpassout is 2024 and 3. city is chennai
       Which statment you use:    ifs? if-elses?  while? do-while?

8. Switch(case) -> you can match case as case 'a', case 1, case true, case "Monday"
    Is this true?

9. What's mean by sub class, sub type, derived class?
10. What's mean by generic method?
11. What's mean by concrete method?
12. What's mean by abstract method?
13. Object creation mechanisms
14. C++  - oops - Pointer with Class - encapsulation is cancelled
15. String Functions.
16. Constructor Overloading
