Step 1: Create Sample Tables
CREATE TABLE employees_A (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE employees_B (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2)
);
Step 2: Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO employees_A (name, salary)
VALUES
    ('John Doe', 60000),
    ('Alice Johnson', 70000),
    ('Sara Lee', 80000);
INSERT INTO employees_B (name, salary)
VALUES
    ('Bob Williams', 70000),
    ('Jane Smith', 60000),
    ('Sara Lee', 80000);

select * from employees_A;
select * from employees_B;
*****************************************************************************************
1. UNION
-- tell participants to select 1 column and 2 columns in other table
SELECT name, salary FROM employees_A
UNION
SELECT name, salary FROM employees_B;
2. 2. UNION ALL
SELECT name, salary FROM employees_A
UNION ALL
SELECT name, salary FROM employees_B;
3.INTERSECT
SELECT name, salary FROM employees_A
INTERSECT
SELECT name, salary FROM employees_B;

4. EXCEPT

SELECT name, salary FROM employees_A

WHERE salary > 60000;
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees_A
WHERE salary >= 60000;
SELECT name, salary

WHERE salary < 70000;

-- INSERT INTO employees_A (name, salary)
VALUES
    ('Dijo', 4000);
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees_A
WHERE salary < ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees_B);
