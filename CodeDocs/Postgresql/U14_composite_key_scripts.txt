-- Maintain Data integrity
Step 1: Create the employees Table

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Primary key for the employee
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,       -- Name of the employee, must not be null
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL            -- Date the employee was hired, must not be null
);


Step 2: Create the roles Table with Composite Key
CREATE TABLE roles (
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,           -- Reference to the employee (foreign key)
    department_id INT NOT NULL,         -- Reference to the department (foreign key)
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,          -- Role of the employee in the department
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, department_id),  -- Composite primary key
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  -- Foreign key constraint
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id) ON DELETE CASCADE  -- Foreign key constraint
);
Step 3: Create the departments Table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Primary key for the department
    department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE  -- Name of the department, must be unique
);
Step 4: Insert Sample Data
-- Insert sample departments
INSERT INTO departments (department_name) VALUES
('Human Resources'),
('Engineering'),
('Marketing');

-- Insert sample employees
INSERT INTO employees (name, hire_date) VALUES
('Alice Johnson', '2022-01-15'),
('Bob Smith', '2021-05-30'),
('Charlie Brown', '2023-03-25');

-- Insert sample roles
INSERT INTO roles (employee_id, department_id, role) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Recruiter'),           -- Alice in HR
(1, 2, 'Software Engineer'),    -- Alice in Engineering
(2, 1, 'HR Manager'),           -- Bob in HR
(2, 3, 'Marketing Specialist'),  -- Bob in Marketing
(3, 2, 'Data Scientist');        -- Charlie in Engineering
Step 5: Demonstrate the Composite Key
Inserting a Record with Duplicate Composite Key:
Inserting a Valid Record:

INSERT INTO roles (employee_id, department_id, role) VALUES
(3, 1, 'HR Intern');  -- This will succeed because Charlie has no current role in HR

INSERT INTO roles (employee_id, department_id, role) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Senior Recruiter');  -- This will fail because Alice already has a role in HR
