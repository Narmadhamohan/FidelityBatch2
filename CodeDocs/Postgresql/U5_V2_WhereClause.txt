-- Create a sample employees table
-- drop table employees;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2),
    department VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert sample data into employees table
INSERT INTO employees (name, salary, department) VALUES
('John Doe', 50000, 'HR'),
('Jane Smith', 60000, 'Engineering'),
('Alice Johnson', 70000, 'Engineering'),
('Bob Williams', 45000, 'Marketing'),
('Sara Lee', 60000, 'HR');

-- Example 1: Using WHERE with equality
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = 60000;

-- Example 2: Using WHERE with inequality
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000;

-- Example 3: Using WHERE with AND condition
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000 AND department = 'Engineering';

-- Example 4: Using WHERE with OR condition
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'Marketing';

-- Example 5: Using WHERE with NOT condition
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT department = 'Engineering';

-- Example 6: Using WHERE with LIKE for pattern matching
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%';  -- Names starting with 'J'

-- Example 7: Using WHERE with ILIKE for case-insensitive pattern matching
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name ILIKE 'j%';  -- Names starting with 'j' (case insensitive)

-- Example 8: Using WHERE with IN for matching against a list
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Engineering');

-- Example 9: Using WHERE with BETWEEN for range matching
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000;

-- Example 10: Using WHERE with IS NULL
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NULL;

-- Example 11: Using WHERE with EXISTS (assuming a dependent subquery)
-- show in for the below option, so that students understand
SELECT * FROM employees e WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE department = e.department AND salary > 60000
);
SELECT * FROM employees e WHERE name IN (
    SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = e.department AND salary > 60000
);
